Limitations:
- currently implemented to work with OpenAI
- currently all data needs to be publicly available or local path from machine

Ideas for improvements:
- Migrate to AzureOpenAI: [Migration guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742)
- Research how to use data in PostGresGIS / ComsmosDB / SQL over private endpoints (ask CSA)
